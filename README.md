**Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for the detection of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Breast cancer is a significant health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving outcomes. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze the features of breast cancer cells and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
